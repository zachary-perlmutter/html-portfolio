<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Born in Cambodia and adopted at just one and a half years old, the journey to
  Billerica, Massachusetts, was only the beginning of an incredible story. As a
  child, a strong foundation was laid in a loving family and a Catholic high
  school, which helped instill the values that would shape the course of life.
  Initially set on exploring the wonders of the ocean through marine biology, a
  passion for technology took over, leading to a degree in computer science from
  the University of Massachusetts Lowell, accompanied by a math minor. This
  shift in interests set the stage for a remarkable career in the world of
  technology.

  Starting with an internship in the IT department of an electrical engineering
  company, opportunity came knocking when the company was acquired and a move to
  sunny Florida materialized. As part of the software engineering team, a
  diverse skillset was developed, focusing on Microsoft Windows system images,
  cybersecurity, and DevOps. This dedication and expertise led to a promotion to
  the highly coveted position of Site Reliability Engineer, where the
  responsibility of building out DevOps for the company was entrusted.

  Outside of a thriving professional life, an entrepreneurial spirit blossomed.
  A web design, marketing, and content management business was launched with a
  close friend, showcasing an innate ability to adapt and excel in various
  fields. A true sports enthusiast, basketball is both a favorite pastime and a
  beloved spectator sport, while tennis offers a chance to showcase individual
  prowess on the court. Additionally, playing kickball with friends from the
  apartment complex helps foster camaraderie and a sense of community. With an
  unyielding entrepreneurial mindset, there's no challenge too great to be
  conquered.
