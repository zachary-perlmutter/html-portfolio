<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Zach</h1>

<h2>My top 3 favorite movies are...</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite movie of all time because I love Morgan Freedman. The time
  period of the movie is so simple and I love the suspese of how he tries to
  escape prison.
</p>

<h3>Kung Fu Panda 2</h3>
<p>
  This movie takes second place because I can releate to it so much. Po was
  found by his adopted father and he begins to find the true meaning of where he
  came from. Oogway also has oodles of wisdom.
</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>
  I love the soundtrack for this movie. Donkey is hilarous and the storyline is
  just amazing. I could watch this movie 1000 times and it would not get old.
